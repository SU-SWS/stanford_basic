Installation
---

Install this theme like any other theme. [See Drupal Documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-themes)

This theme depends on the [`Components`](https://www.drupal.org/project/components) module to register template
namespaces. If downloading this theme via composer, the module is already downloaded and simply needs to be enabled
before the theme can be enabled.

If using this theme in conjunction with configuration management and doing site install, a patch is included in the
composer.json. Ensure that your project's root composer.json has [patching enabled](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches#allowing-patches-to-be-applied-from-dependencies)
or download and patch Drupal Core manually.

Configuration
---

Nothing special needed. Install, enable, and set as the default active theme. Once you have the theme enabled, be sure to check out the appearance settings for additional configuration items.


Troubleshooting
---

If you are experiencing issues with this theme try disabling and clear the cache first. If you are still experiencing issues try posting an issue on the GitHub issues page.

This theme is not intended to be used as an administration theme. Please use something else for that.

Releases
---

Steps to build a new release:
- Checkout the latest commit from the `8.x-4.x` branch.
- Create a new branch for the release.
- Commit any necessary changes to the release branch.
  -  These may include, but are not necessarily limited to:
    - Update the version in any `info.yml` files, including in any submodules.
    - Update the CHANGELOG to reflect the changes made in the new release.
- Make a PR to merge your release branch into `master`
- Give the PR a semver-compliant label, e.g., (`patch`, `minor`, `major`).  This may happen automatically via Github actions (if a labeler action is configured).
- When the PR is merged to `master`, a new tag will be created automatically, bumping the version by the semver label.
- The github action is built from: [semver-release-action](https://github.com/K-Phoen/semver-release-action), and further documentation is available there.
