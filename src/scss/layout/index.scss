//  Macro arrangement of a web page, including any grid systems.
//  Grid systems should be thought of as shelves. They contain content but are
//  not content in themselves. You put up your shelves then fill them with your
//  stuff [i.e. components]. – Harry Roberts, CSS Guidelines
//
//  Separate style from behavior by using dedicated classes for JavaScript
//  manipulation rather than relying on classes already in use for CSS. This way,
//  we can modify classes for style purposes without fear of breaking JS, and
//  vice versa. To make the distinction clear, classes used for JavaScript
//  manipulation should be prefixed with 'js-'. These JavaScript hooks must never
//  be used for styling purposes. See the section ‘Formatting Class Names’ for
//  more information on naming conventions.
